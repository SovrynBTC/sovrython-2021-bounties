Bounties on offer for sovrython.sovryn.app 

Bitcoin-native DeFi is an unexplored galaxy in the blockchain universe. Take part in pioneering this new sector with us as we build the future of a borderless, digital financial operating system.

Sovryn, the leading protocol for DeFi on Bitcoin, is proud to announce Sovrython, a virtual conference and hackathon taking place from June 4th - July 18th, 2021, with $250k in bounties and $250k in post-hackathon grants for promising projects. This amounts to $500k of support for developing open-source DeFi software that integrates with the Sovryn protocol and platform. Bounties and grants will be paid out in Sovryn’s native token, $SOV.

Bitcoin is the solid foundation upon which to build the future of finance. It is transparent, incorruptible, programmable money. Innovating on Bitcoin does not mean changing Bitcoin Mainchain - it means building new layers of superpowers that extend the capabilities of Bitcoin. Sovrython is an opportunity to join other Bitcoin Mutants at the cutting edge of blockchain tech: sidechains, DeFi, Lightning Network, and Layer 2 systems.

##Sovrython Partner Bounties and Grants

In addition to the $500k in bounties/grants provided by Sovryn, Sovrython will feature additional partner bounties in the Gitcoin explorer. These partners hail from blockchain ecosystems that are in alignment with our mission to boldly move forward in building Bitcoin-focused DeFi together. If you or your company/project would like to sponsor an additional partner bounty, please use the Sovrython Signup Form no later than Friday, May 28th.

At the time of publishing, we are delighted to announce the following partners:

##Akash.network

Akash Network, the world’s first decentralized and open-source cloud, accelerates deployment, scale, efficiency, and price performance for high-growth industries like blockchain and machine learning/AI. Known as the "Airbnb for Cloud," Akash Network provides a fast, efficient, and low-cost application deployment solution. Developers leveraging Akash Network can access cloud computing at up to three times less than the cost of centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Utilizing containerization technology, Akash Network leverages 85% of underutilized cloud capacity in 8.4 million global data centers, enabling anyone to buy and sell cloud computing.. Akash’s Interoperable Proof of Stake Blockchain is an open and globally consistent shared state machine that guarantees sovereignty over data and runtime with a high-performance RPC layer with multi-language libraries and bi-directional streaming.

Akash is providing an additional $100k in bounties and grants for Sovrython.



##API3

API3 is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way, that is governed by a DAO. At its core, API3 brings the ability for API providers to easily run their own oracle nodes to provide data on-chain without an intermediary to any decentralized application. At the heart of this mechanism sits Airnode, an open-source oracle node that is designed to be easily deployed by any API provider with almost no maintenance. With Airnode, dApp developers can write smart contracts to interact with the on-chain data of API providers.

API3 is providing $25k worth of bounties for submissions to Sovrython which integrate their open-source oracle, Airnode. Sovryn is matching this amount, for a total of $50k in bounties.



##Interlay

Interlay envisions a future where blockchains can seamlessly connect and interact, regardless of their design and purpose. Anyone should be able to use any digital currency on any blockchain platform without restrictions. Interlay's mission is to enable Bitcoin holders to easily earn passive income on their BTC holdings by investing in decentralized financial products on any blockchain - without trusting centralized services.



##ENS Domains

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain which enables developers to map human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum and other chain addresses.




##Sovrython Speakers and Judges 

The virtual conference will take place online at sovrython.sovryn.app utilizing the open-source conference platform interspace.chat. We are programming three days of talks at the beginning of the Sovrython from 4 - 6 June, and for three days at the end of the Sovrython from 16 - 18 July. All talks will be available on the Sovrython Event Calendar. Together with the cryptoliberation association, Parallele Polis, we are putting together an exciting lineup of speakers and judges from all across the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Web3 and DeFi ecosystems. If you would like to apply to give a talk, participate in a panel discussion, or act as a judge, complete the Sign-up Form no later than Friday, May 28th.
